# mvtools.vpy
This vapoursynth filter script is a fork of haasn's "mvtools.vpy" and maoiscat's "mvtools_3.py" scripts featured in the awesome-mpv script compilation. This script retains the option to skip frame rate conversion for videos exceeding FHD resolution or those with a frame rate of >60fps―a feature found in haasn's original script―while using maoiscat's logical operations.

※someone pls fork [stax76]([url](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/wiki/Using-VapourSynth-in-mpv.net))'s [VapourSynth script]([url](https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/wiki/Using-VapourSynth-in-mpv.net)https://github.com/mpvnet-player/mpv.net/wiki/Using-VapourSynth-in-mpv.net). It enables users to reuduce & increase motion interpolation quality; however, it only seems to work with mpv.net instead of mpv because mpv doesn't have context menus.
