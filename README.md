# mvtools.vpy
This vapoursynth filter script is a fork of haasn's "mvtools.vpy" and maoiscat's "mvtools_3.py" scripts featured in the awesome-mpv script compilation. This script retains the option to skip frame rate conversion for videos with >2K resolution or those with a frame rate exceeding your monitor's refresh rate―a feature found in haasn's original script―while using maoiscat's logical operations.
