# mvtools.lua
This vapoursynth filter script is a fork of haasn's "mvtools.vpy" and maoiscat's "mvtools_3.py" scripts featured in the awesome-mpv script compilation. This script retains the option to skip frame rate conversion for videos with >4K resolution or those with a frame rate exceeding your monitor's refresh rate―a feature found in haasn's original script―while using maoiscat's logical operations.

※Remember to change the file extension from "mvtools.vpy" to "mvtools.lua" in your mpv.conf.
Example: vf=vapoursynth="C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\mpv\scripts\mvtools.lua"
