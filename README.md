# mvtools.lua
This script is a fork of nand's "mvtools.vpy" and maoiscat's "mvtools_3.py" script featured in the awesome-mpv script compilation. This script retains the integrity of the frame rate conversion option found in the original script while using maoiscat's logical operations. I've commented out my code with a hash symbol and two hyphens so my comments don't pass through the compiler.

â€»Remember to change the file extension in your mpv.conf vapoursynth directory. Example: vf=vapoursynth="C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\mpv\scripts\mvtools.lua"
