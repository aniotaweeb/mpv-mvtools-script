# mvtools.lua
This vapoursynth filter script is a fork of nand's "mvtools.vpy" and maoiscat's "mvtools_3.py" scripts featured in the awesome-mpv script compilation. This script retains the option to skip frame rate conversion for videos with 4K resolution―a feature found in nand's original script―while using maoiscat's logical operations.

※Remember to change the file extension from "mvtools.vpy" to "mvtools.lua" in your mpv.conf.
Example: vf=vapoursynth="C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Roaming\mpv\scripts\mvtools.lua"
